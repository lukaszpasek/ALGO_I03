Observer  The Moderately Capable Intrigants group has been active in the Byteland underworld for many years. This time, in order to raise funds for further activities, they decided to make a jump to the Byteotian Governors Casino. Of course, such a serious operation must begin with a thorough reconnaissance of the area. In order to obtain the necessary information, the Observer needs to keep an eye on many strategic points in and around the Casino. Unfortunately, the distance between them makes this task much more difficult. The schemers therefore consider hiring a second Observer and dividing the work between them. However, such a decision comes with some risk (and significant costs!), So they want to be sure that it will bring any results.  Given the coordinates of all strategic places, decide if they can be divided between the two Observers in such a way that the diameter (the greatest distance between two points) of the subset allocated to each is smaller than the set before the split.
